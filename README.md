# PlayingCards
Assembly library classes for a standard set of playing cards (cards, hands, decks and images)

Library containing implmentation of Playing Cards, including classes for the cards, images, hands,
and deck.  Images mainly based on images created for the QCard.dll created by Stephen Murphy many
years ago.  QCard was converted to use within OS/2 and called QCard2.dll, specifically written for
SpeedSoft Sybil (returned Sybil TBitMaps).  Library rewritten in Java and made generic (can be used
to implement card sets other than playing cards).  The libraray was then re-written and made simpler
using C# in 12/2013 for use in VS .net card games (more object oriented with proper enums and properties,
along with using LINQ for first time).

Library last editted/compiled using VS 2019.
