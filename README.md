# PlayingCards
Assembly library class for a standard playing cards (cards, hands, decks and images)

Library containing implmentation of Playing Cards, including the cards, images, hands,
and deck.  Images mainly based on images created for the QCard.dll created by
Stephen Murphy many years ago.  Converted to Java in 2001, converted from a project for OS/2
called QCard2.dll, specifically written for SpeedSoft Sybil (returns Sybil TBitMaps).  Library
re-written and made better in C# in 12/2013 for use in VS .net card games (more object oriented
with proper enums and properties, along with using LINQ for first time).

Library last editted/compiled using VS 2019.
