Assembly library class for a standard playing cards (cards, hands, decks and images)

Library containing implmentation of Playing Cards, including the cards, images, hands,
and deck.  Images mainly based on images created for the QCard.dll created by
Stephen Murphy many years ago.  Updated to work with OS/2 with QCard2.dll, specifically
writtent for SpeedSoft Sybil (returns Sybil TBitMaps).  Library re-written and made
better in C# in 12/2013 for use in VS .net card games (more object oriented with
proper enums and properties, along with using LINQ for first time).
